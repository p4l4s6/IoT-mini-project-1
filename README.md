## Description
The goal of this project was to create a software solution enabling the secure and energy-efficient transmission of sensor data from Smart Objects to a cloud backend. Additionally, the collected data will be visualized through the cloud. To accomplish this objective, we developed firmware for Smart Objects using the open source operating system RIOT. The software will undergo evaluation in an IoT testbed (FIT-IoT Testbed), operating on real IoT hardware and an IPv6 connection.

## Server and Sensor details
To run this project you can use already setup cloud server mentioned in below or you can setup your own cloud server by using the instruction in Preparing the Backend section. If you use the below cloud server skip the Preparing the Backend section.
Cloud server:
```
IPv4: 16.170.238.248
IPv6: 2a05:d016:eea:c800:ca30:d1a0:b5e6:7e41
```
The IPv6 range of the grenoble site of FIT-IoT Lab. If you are using the different site you can get the ipv6 range for that site from this link https://www.iot-lab.info/legacy/tutorials/understand-ipv6-subnetting-on-the-fit-iot-lab-testbed/index.html
Grenoble IP:
```
start range: 2001:660:5307:3101::/64
ending range: 2001:660:5307:317f::/64
```

## Preparing the Backend
If you want to setup your own cloud server use the below instruction

Step 1: Login to your backend cloud server
```
ssh user@server
```
the user is the user of your cloud server and server is the ip of your cloud server. Make sure you have the ability to comiple c++ code in server also Make and Gcc installed in the server.

Step 2: Clone this repository
```
https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto.rsmb.git
```


Step 3: Go to src directory and compile
```
cd rsmb/src
make
```


Step 4: Make a new configuration
```
nano config.conf
```
put the below configuration
```
# Uncomment this to show you packets being sent and received
trace_output protocol

# Normal MQTT listener
listener 1883 INADDR_ANY
ipv6 true

# MQTT-SN listener
listener 1883 INADDR_ANY mqtts
ipv6 true
```



Step 5: Run MQTT server using the above configuration
```
./broker_mqtts config.conf
```

Leave the terminal open

## Preparing the Frontend
This code should be running on your own laptop/desktop. You need python 3.9+ installed in your laptop and desktop to run the below instructions.

Step 1: Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/p4l4s6/IoT-mini-project-1.git
```


Step 2: create a virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
```


Step 3: Install the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Step 4: Run the frontend code
```
python frontend.py
```

leave the terminal open and once the data is published from FiT IoT Lab node it will show here.

## Preparing the IoT Devices

These instructions are for running your FIT IoT Lab nodes.

```
Cloud server IPv4: 16.170.238.248
Cloud server IPv6: 2a05:d016:eea:c800:ca30:d1a0:b5e6:7e41
```

Step 1: Log in to the IoT lab server using SSH
```
ssh USERNAME@grenoble.iot-lab.info
```
replace the username with your own FiT IOT Lab Username.

Step 2: Submit an experiment
```
iotlab-experiment submit -n NAME_OF_EXP -d 120 -l 2,archi=m3:at86rf231+site=grenoble
```
replace NAME_OF_EXP with your desired name for the experiment. once you submit the experiment note down the experiment id which is required for the next step.

Wait for the experiment to be started


Step 3: Get the idâ€™s of nodes
```
iotlab-experiment get -i <exp_id> -p
```
replace <exp_id> with the id you have noted from previous step. Also note the id's of the nodes you get from using this command. ID of the nodes are required for the next steps.


Step 4: Clone the RIOT repo
```
git clone https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT.git
```


Step 5: Go to the RIOT directory and set source
```
cd RIOT
source /opt/riot.source
```


Step 6: compile gnrc border router
```
make ETHOS_BAUDRATE=500000 DEFAULT_CHANNEL=26 BOARD=iotlab-m3 -C examples/gnrc_border_router clean all
```


Step 7: Flash the router firmware in the first node
```
iotlab-node --update examples/gnrc_border_router/bin/iotlab-m3/gnrc_border_router.elf -l grenoble,m3,ID_OF_M3_FIRST_NODE
```
replace ID_OF_M3_FIRST_NODE with first node id you get from Step 3.

Step 8: Create a network interface for the border router
```
sudo ethos_uhcpd.py m3-ID_OF_BORDER_NODE  tap0 2001:660:5307:3101::/64
```

replace ID_OF_BORDER_NODE with 1st node id you got from step3. if you are using grenoble site you can use this 2001:660:5307:3101::/64. If you are using other site make sure you are using the IP range that is supported in that site. you can get the supported IP range from this url.
https://www.iot-lab.info/legacy/tutorials/understand-ipv6-subnetting-on-the-fit-iot-lab-testbed/index.html

Note: make sure tap interface is running. if there is any error try changing tap0 to tap5 or tap6 something similar like this.

Leave terminal open


Step 9: open a new terminal and login to IoT lab server again using ssh and clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/p4l4s6/IoT-mini-project-1.git
```


Step 10: go to the project directory and set source and compile the firmware
```
cd IoT-mini-project-1/iot/
source /opt/riot.source
make
```


Step 11: Flash firmware to the second node
```
iotlab-node --update bin/iotlab-m3/emcute_mqttsn.elf -l grenoble,m3,ID_OF_M3_SECOND_NODE
```
replace ID_OF_M3_SECOND_NODE with 2nd node id you got from step3

Step 12:  Open the second node shell
```
nc m3-ID_OF_M3_SECOND_NODE 20000
```
replace ID_OF_M3_SECOND_NODE with 2nd node id you got from step3

Step 13: Connect to the backend server
```
con 2a05:d016:eea:c800:ca30:d1a0:b5e6:7e41 1885
```
if you are using your own cloud server replace 2a05:d016:eea:c800:ca30:d1a0:b5e6:7e41 this with your cloud ipv6 address and  1885 with your cloud RSMB port.

Step 14: Print the data into the terminal
```
data
```

Step 14: send data to MQTT server
```
apub
```
